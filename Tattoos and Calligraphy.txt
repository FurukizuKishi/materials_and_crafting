ink, like potions (alchemy)
plant ink
gemstone ink (can be enchanted)

can be used for scrolls (spell scrolls if magical) and (magical) tattoos
scrolls are consumable, tattoos are permanent
if one has the ink, a spell scroll can be crafted in a long rest, and a tattoo can be applied in a week
tattoos are permanent body modifications and cannot be removed

magical tattoos transform the bearer into a magic item
magical tattoos prevent the owner from attuning to magic items
