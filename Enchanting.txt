Runes have an expression radius, which is how far their magic conducts into a material. This radius is measured in inches, and is equal to the level of the rune.

The MCI of a material alters the area of a rune's expression if it is placed on it, increasing or decreasing the amount that a rune's expression can extend out from
the material. Expression radius changes by a number of inches equal to MCI.

When a rune's magic enters a new material, you alter the radius by the difference between the old material and the new material to see how much further the magic
can extend. Magic works like movement speed in a battle, in that consuming radius means that you can reduce the amount you can extend further.

Rune ribbons can be used to manipulate the area, limiting its width to multiply its length.

When creating an enchantment, you must enchant the rune with a spell of a level that it can fit. Upcast spells give an additional inch of expression radius for each
level they are upcast.

Magical abilities (eg: class abilities, racial abilities, etc. that the DM deems magical) can also form the basis for enchantments. They have levels as well, which
work in a similar way to spell levels.

 - If the ability uses a resource (eg: sorcery points, ki, etc.), the level of the ability is determined by halving the resource cost, and rounding up. For example, a
   sorcerer's metamagic would be a 1st-level ability. If the ability can be upscaled by spending additional resource, one point equals one additional spell level.

 - Otherwise, the ability is levelled based on the class level it was obtained. This is calculated based on the levels that a full caster would gain their spell slots. 
   If it can be recharged, a short-rest recharge increases it by one spell level, and a long-rest recharge increases it by two. For example, a hexblade's baleful curse
   would count as a 2nd-level ability, as it is gained at 1st level, and is recharged on a short or long rest.

Each enchantment's initial expression radius (at the rune, including its etched material and inlays) is used in a point buy system, the categories of which are
determined on an individual enchantment basis. If two separate enchantments overlap in expression area, they may be combined to form a new point buy, and a new
more complex enchantment. If a rune's expression area overlaps with multiple other runes', its enchantment may be split up into any or all of them, altering all of the
enchantments it offered into new ones.
