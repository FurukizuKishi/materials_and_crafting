Runes have an expression radius, which is how far their magic conducts into a material. This radius is measured in inches, and is equal to the level of the rune.

The MCI of a material alters the area of a rune's expression if it is placed on it, increasing or decreasing the amount that a rune's expression can extend out from
the material. Expression radius changes by a number of inches equal to MCI.

When a rune's magic enters a new material, you alter the radius by the difference between the old material and the new material to see how much further the magic
can extend. Magic works like movement speed in a battle, in that consuming radius means that you can reduce the amount you can extend further.

Rune ribbons can be used to manipulate the area, limiting its width to multiply its length.
